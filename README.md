Bike-POV-Arduino
================
This code, given the proper components, allows you to display
the speed you are traveling on your bike wheel. The code calculates the
speed you are going in kilometers per hour based on the rate that your 
bike wheel is spinning. 

I created this project simply because I wanted to. The project looked cool, I had
the components to do it, and I wanted to learn something new. Below is a more in
depth overview of how the project works, and a little insight of my experience
throughout the project.
